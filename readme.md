# CSC 6210 Final Project - Full Stack MERN project

This is a simple app made by Aidan Schneider to perform CRUD operations on a database meant to contain the Green Bay Packers players, but it could easily be modified to contain the players of any sports team. It's not the most pretty, but it's fully functional.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the included JSON file (root/DB.json) into a MongoDB database.
3. Open a terminal in the root/backend directory and run the command "node install"
4. Open a terminal in the root/frontend directory and run the command "node install"
5. In **both** the /frontend and /backend directories, run the command "npm run dev"
6. Use the link provided by the running frontend application to access the web project.
